                    Hi, my name is Brian Lee. I was born on February 10, 1998 in Gaithersburg Maryland.
                    I first developed a love for coding in high school when I took my first computer science class.
                    The mix between creativity and math was so appealing, knowing that there were limitless projects I could make.
                    There was always a new technology I could learn and implement to serve a purpose in what I was making.
                    In the Fall of 2020, during the Covid 19 outbreak, I decided to take the UC Berkeley extension coding bootcamp.
                    I alongside 30 plus classmates endured a 3 month intensive course focused on web developement.
                    My current portfolio mainly consists of projects from that course.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    I have many different projects focused on different aspects of Web developement.
                    Throughout the coding bootcamp, the 3 month progression can be seen.
                    I am still learning new technologies to add to my repertoire.
